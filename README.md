# Tag V0

Tag is a React Native application that allows students to find and split rides with other students and save information.

## Next Steps
Current timeline for deployment to Test Flight is first week of January. Currently working on bug fixes and styling.

## Installation

To install the application, you need to have Node.js, npm, and React Native installed on your machine. Then, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razorback4417/tagDev1.git
cd tag
npm install
```

Then run `npx expo install` (make sure `npx` and `expo` are installed).
